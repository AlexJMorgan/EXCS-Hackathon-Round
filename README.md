# EXCS Hackathon Round

You'll write a method that'll make an AI play tetris. Performance will be determined by highest score and creativity.

## Instructions
- Extract `tetris.py` and `tetris_ai.py` into a single folder.
    - You can do a pull request, download, or copy and paste the code.
- Complete the `move_piece` method in the `tetris_ai.py` file.
- Do NOT modify the `tetris.py` file.
- Run the `tetris.py` file from a console or your IDE.

## Things to keep in mind:
- Per 'tick' (defaulted to every 0.5 seconds), the piece will fall one square and you can either move it left, right, down or rotate it once.
- Get board information using board.tiles[x][y]
- Crtl C will exit your program if you get stuck in a loop.

## Submission

- Email your tetris_ai.py to jp910@exeter.ac.uk
- Be sure to include your team name and a short summary of your implementation!
