# EXCS Hackathon Round

Write a method that'll make an AI play tetris. Performance will be determined by highest score and creativity! Feel free to write your own functions and implement your own loops to find gaps.

## Instructions
- Extract `tetris.py` and `tetris_ai.py` into a single folder.
    - You can do a pull request, download, or copy and paste the code.
- Complete the `move_piece` method in the `tetris_ai.py` file.
- Do NOT modify the `tetris.py` file.
- Run the `tetris.py` file from a console or your IDE.

## Things to keep in mind:
- Per 'tick' (default is every 0.5 seconds), the piece will fall one square and you can either move it left, right, down or rotate it once.
- Get board information using board.tiles[x][y]
- Crtl C will exit your program if you get stuck in a loop.

## Submission

- Email your tetris_ai.py to jp910@exeter.ac.uk
- A MAXIMUM of 2 submissions per team, preferably in the same email.
- Be sure to include your team name and a short summary of your implementation!
